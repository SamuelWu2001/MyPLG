# MyPLG - Basketball App

This is a full stack project utilizing React Native for the mobile app development, Nest.js for the backend, and Swagger for API documentation. The project aims to create an application based on [PLG](https://pleagueofficial.com/) 
(Taiwan's professional basketball league). In addition to basic features such as displaying information about games, teams, and players, MyPLG introduces a new feature: the creation of discussion rooms. These discussion rooms 
provide basketball fans a platform to discuss and chat.
